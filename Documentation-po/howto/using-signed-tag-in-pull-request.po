"Subject: Using signed tag in pull requests\n"
"Abstract: Beginning v1.7.9, a contributor can push a signed tag to her\n"
" publishing repository and ask her integrator to pull it. This assures the\n"
" integrator that the pulled history is authentic and allows others to\n"
" later validate it.\n"

"A typical distributed workflow using Git is for a contributor to fork a "
"project, build on it, publish the result to her public repository, and ask "
"the \"upstream\" person (often the owner of the project where she forked "
"from) to pull from her public repository. Requesting such a \"pull\" is made "
"easy by the `git request-pull` command."

"contributor forked her work from, the message did not say anything about the "
"commit to expect at the tip of the for-xyzzy branch. If the site that hosts "
"the public repository of the contributor cannot be fully trusted, it was "

"resulting merge commit records the content of the signed tag, so that other "
"people can verify that the branch merged by the integrator was signed by the "
"contributor, without fetching the signed tag used to validate the pull "
