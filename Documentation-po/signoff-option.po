"Add a `Signed-off-by` trailer by the committer at the end of the commit log "
"message.  The meaning of a signoff depends on the project to which you're "
"committing.  For example, it may certify that the committer has the rights "
"to submit the work under the project's license or agrees to some contributor "
"representation, such as a Developer Certificate of Origin.  (See "
"http://developercertificate.org for the one used by the Linux kernel and Git "
"projects.)  Consult the documentation or leadership of the project to which "
"you're contributing to understand how the signoffs are used in that project."
