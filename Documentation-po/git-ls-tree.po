"the behaviour is slightly different from that of \"/bin/ls\" in that the "

"the behaviour is similar to that of \"/bin/ls\" in that the '<path>' is "
"taken as relative to the current working directory.  E.g. when you are in a "
"directory 'sub' that has a directory 'dir', you can run 'git ls-tree -r HEAD "
"dir' to list the contents of the tree (that is `sub/dir` in `HEAD`).  You "
"don't want to give a tree that is not at the root level (e.g. `git ls-tree "
"-r HEAD:sub dir`) in this case, as that would result in asking for "
"`sub/sub/dir` in the `HEAD` commit.  However, the current working directory "
"can be ignored by passing --full-tree option."
