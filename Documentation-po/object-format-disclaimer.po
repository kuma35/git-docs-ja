"THIS OPTION IS EXPERIMENTAL! SHA-256 support is experimental and still in an "
"early stage.  A SHA-256 repository will in general not be able to share work "
"with \"regular\" SHA-1 repositories.  It should be assumed that, e.g., Git "
"internal file formats in relation to SHA-256 repositories may change in "
"backwards-incompatible ways.  Only use `--object-format=sha256` for testing "
"purposes."
