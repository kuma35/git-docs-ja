"After the rerere mechanism reuses a recorded resolution on the current "
"conflict to update the files in the working tree, allow it to also update "
"the index with the result of resolution.  `--no-rerere-autoupdate` is a good "
"way to double-check what `rerere` did and catch potential mismerges, before "
"committing the result to the index with a separate `git add`."
