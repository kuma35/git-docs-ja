"The sparse-checkout feature allows users to focus a working directory on a "
"subset of the files at HEAD. The cone mode patterns, enabled by "
"`core.sparseCheckoutCone`, allow for very fast pattern matching to discover "
"which files at HEAD belong in the sparse-checkout cone."

"We will use big-O notation -- O(X) -- to denote how expensive certain "
"operations are in terms of these dimensions."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../Documentation/technical/sparse-index.txt:22
msgid ""
"These dimensions are ordered by their magnitude: users (typically) modify "
"fewer files than are populated, and we can only populate files at `HEAD`."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../Documentation/technical/sparse-index.txt:30
msgid ""
"Problems occur if there is an extreme imbalance in these dimensions. For "
"example, if `HEAD` contains millions of paths but the populated set has only "
"tens of thousands, then commands like `git status` and `git add` can be "
"dominated by operations that require O(`HEAD`) operations instead of "
"O(Populated). Primarily, the cost is in parsing and rewriting the index, "
"which is filled primarily with files at `HEAD` that are marked with the "
"`SKIP_WORKTREE` bit."

#. type: Plain text
#: ../Documentation/technical/sparse-index.txt:34
msgid ""
"The sparse-index intends to take these commands that read and modify the "
"index from O(`HEAD`) to O(Populated). To do this, we need to modify the "
"index format in a significant way: add \"sparse directory\" entries."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../Documentation/technical/sparse-index.txt:42
msgid ""
"With cone mode patterns, it is possible to detect when an entire directory "
"will have its contents outside of the sparse-checkout definition.  Instead "
"of listing all of the files it contains as individual entries, a "
"sparse-index contains an entry with the directory name, referencing the "
"object ID of the tree at `HEAD` and marked with the `SKIP_WORKTREE` bit.  If "
"we need to discover the details for paths within that directory, we can "
"parse trees to find that list."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../Documentation/technical/sparse-index.txt:54
msgid ""
"At time of writing, sparse-directory entries violate expectations about the "
"index format and its in-memory data structure. There are many consumers in "
"the codebase that expect to iterate through all of the index entries and see "
"only files. In fact, these loops expect to see a reference to every staged "
"file. One way to handle this is to parse trees to replace a sparse-directory "
"entry with all of the files within that tree as the index is "
"loaded. However, parsing trees is slower than parsing the index format, so "
"that is a slower operation than if we left the index alone. The plan is to "
"make all of these integrations \"sparse aware\" so this expansion through "
"tree parsing is unnecessary and they use fewer resources than when using a "
"full index."

"The implementation plan below follows four phases to slowly integrate with "
"the sparse-index. The intention is to incrementally update Git commands to "
"interact safely with the sparse-index without significant slowdowns. This "
"may not always be possible, but the hope is that the primary commands that "
"users need in their daily work are dramatically improved."

"During this phase, Git learns to enable the sparse-index and safely parse "
"one. Protections are put in place so that every consumer of the in-memory "
"data structure can operate with its current assumption of every file at "
"`HEAD`."
msgstr ""

#. type: Plain text
#: ../Documentation/technical/sparse-index.txt:75

"At first, every index parse will call a helper method, "
"`ensure_full_index()`, which scans the index for sparse-directory entries "
"(pointing to trees) and replaces them with the full list of paths (with blob "
"contents) by parsing tree objects. This will be slower in all cases.  The "
"only noticeable change in behavior will be that the serialized index file "
"contains sparse-directory entries."

#. type: Plain text

msgid ""
"To start, we use a new required index extension, `sdir`, to allow inserting "
"sparse-directory entries into indexes with file format versions 2, 3, and "
"4. This prevents Git versions that do not understand the sparse-index from "
"operating on one, while allowing tools that do not understand the "
"sparse-index to operate on repositories as long as they do not interact with "
"the index. A new format, index v5, will be introduced that includes "
"sparse-directory entries by default. It might also introduce other features "
"that have been considered for improving the index, as well."

#. type: Plain text

"Next, consumers of the index will be guarded against operating on a "
"sparse-index by inserting calls to `ensure_full_index()` or "
"`expand_index_to_path()`. If a specific path is requested, then those will "
"be protected from within the `index_file_exists()` and `index_name_pos()` "
"API calls: they will call `ensure_full_index()` if necessary. The intention "
"here is to preserve existing behavior when interacting with a "
"sparse-checkout. We don't want a change to happen by accident, without "
"tests. Many of these locations may not need any change before removing the "
"guards, but we should not do so without tests to ensure the expected "
"behavior happens."
