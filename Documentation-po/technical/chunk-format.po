"Some file formats in Git use a common concept of \"chunks\" to describe "
"sections of the file. This allows structured access to a large file by "
"scanning a small \"table of contents\" for the remaining data. This common "
"format is used by the `commit-graph` and `multi-pack-index` files. See "
"link:technical/pack-format.html[the `multi-pack-index` format] and "
"link:technical/commit-graph-format.html[the `commit-graph` format] for how "
"they use the chunks to describe structured data."
