"At its core, the Git version control system is a content addressable "
"filesystem. It uses the SHA-1 hash function to name content. For example, "
"files, directories, and revisions are referred to by hash values unlike in "
"other traditional version control systems where files or versions are "
"referred to via sequential numbers. The use of a hash function to address "
"its content delivers a few advantages:"
