"The Git object directory contains a 'pack' directory containing packfiles "
"(with suffix \".pack\") and pack-indexes (with suffix \".idx\"). The pack-"
"indexes provide a way to lookup objects and navigate to their offset within "
"the pack, but these must come in pairs with the packfiles. This pairing "
"depends on the file names, as the pack-index differs only in suffix with its "
"pack- file. While the pack-indexes provide fast lookup per packfile, this "
"performance degrades as the number of packfiles increases, because "
"abbreviations need to inspect every packfile and we are more likely to have "
"a miss on our most-recently-used packfile.  For some large repositories, "
"repacking into a single packfile is not feasible due to storage space or "
"excessive repack times."

"The multi-pack-index allows many packfiles, especially in a context where "
"repacking is expensive (such as a very large repo), or unexpected "
"maintenance time is unacceptable (such as a high-demand build machine). "
"However, the multi-pack-index needs to be rewritten in full every time. We "
"can extend the format to be incremental, so writes are fast. By storing a "
"small \"tip\" multi-pack-index that points to large \"base\" MIDX files, we "
"can keep writes fast while still reducing the number of binary searches "
"required for object lookups."

"Packfiles can be marked as \"special\" using empty files that share the "

"information about the packfiles. This allows new states, such as 'repacked' "
"or 'redeltified', that can help with pack maintenance in a multi-pack "
"environment. It may also be helpful to organize packfiles by object type "
"(commit, tree, blob, etc.) and use this metadata to help that maintenance."
