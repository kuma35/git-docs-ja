"In this release, \"git fsck\" defaults to \"git fsck --full\" and checks "
"packfiles, and because of this it will take much longer to complete than "
"before.  If you prefer a quicker check only on loose objects (the old "
"default), you can say \"git fsck --no-full\".  This has been supported by "
"1.5.4 and newer versions of git, so it is safe to write it in your script "

"had been provided for a very long time, the users procrastinated during the "
