"One long-standing flaw in the pack transfer protocol used by \"git clone\" "
"was that there was no way to tell the other end which branch \"HEAD\" points "
"at, and the receiving end needed to guess.  A new capability has been "
"defined in the pack protocol to convey this information so that cloning from "
"a repository with more than one branches pointing at the same commit where "
"the HEAD is at now reliably sets the initial branch in the resulting "
"repository."
