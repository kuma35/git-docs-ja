"With the default Makefile settings, most of the programs are now installed "
"outside your $PATH, except for \"git\", \"gitk\" and some server side "
"programs that need to be accessible for technical reasons.  Invoking a git "
"subcommand as \"git-xyzzy\" from the command line has been deprecated since "
"early 2006 (and officially announced in 1.5.4 release notes); use of them "
"from your scripts after adding output from \"git --exec-path\" to the $PATH "
"is still supported in this release, but users are again strongly encouraged "
"to adjust their scripts to use \"git xyzzy\" form, as we will stop "
