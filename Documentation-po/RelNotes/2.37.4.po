"CVE-2022-39253: When relying on the `--local` clone optimization, Git "
"dereferences symbolic links in the source repository before creating "
"hardlinks (or copies) of the dereferenced link in the destination "
"repository.  This can lead to surprising behavior where arbitrary files are "
"present in a repository's `$GIT_DIR` when cloning from a malicious "
"repository."
