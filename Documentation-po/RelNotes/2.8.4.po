"\"git describe --contains\" often made a hard-to-justify choice of tag to "
"give name to a given commit, because it tried to come up with a name with "
"smallest number of hops from a tag, causing an old commit whose close "
"descendant that is recently tagged were not described with respect to an old "
"tag but with a newer tag.  It did not help that its computation of \"hop\" "
"count was further tweaked to penalize being on a side branch of a merge.  "
"The logic has been updated to favor using the tag with the oldest tagger "
"date, which is a lot easier to explain to the end users: \"We describe a "
"commit in terms of the (chronologically) oldest tag that contains the "
"commit.\""

"Running tests with '-x' option to trace the individual command executions is "
"a useful way to debug test scripts, but some tests that capture the standard "
"error stream and check what the command said can be broken with the trace "
"output mixed in.  When running our tests under \"bash\", however, we can "
"redirect the trace output to another file descriptor to keep the standard "
"error of programs being tested intact."
