"We have prepended $GIT_EXEC_PATH and the path \"git\" is installed in "
"(typically \"/usr/bin\") to $PATH when invoking subprograms and hooks for "
"almost eternity, but the original use case the latter tried to support was "
"semi-bogus (i.e. install git to /opt/foo/git and run it without having "
"/opt/foo on $PATH), and more importantly it has become less and less "
"relevant as Git grew more mainstream (i.e. the users would _want_ to have it "
"on their $PATH).  Stop prepending the path in which \"git\" is installed to "
"users' $PATH, as that would interfere the command search order people depend "
"on (e.g. they may not like versions of programs that are unrelated to Git in "
"/usr/bin and want to override them by having different ones in "
"/usr/local/bin and have the latter directory earlier in their $PATH)."
