"Automated merge conflict handling when changes to symbolic links conflicted "
"were completely broken.  The merge-resolve strategy created a regular file "
"with conflict markers in it in place of the symbolic link.  The default "
"strategy, merge-recursive was even more broken.  It removed the path that "
"was pointed at by the symbolic link.  Both of these problems have been "
"fixed."
