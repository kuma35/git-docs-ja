"Often a fast-import stream builds a new commit on top of the previous commit "
"it built, and it often unconditionally emits a \"from\" command to specify "
"the first parent, which can be omitted in such a case.  This caused "
"fast-import to forget the tree of the previous commit and then re-read it "
"from scratch, which was inefficient.  Optimize for this common case."

"The \"rev-parse --parseopt\" mode parsed the option specification and the "
"argument hint in a strange way to allow '=' and other special characters in "

"impossible to define an option like \"--pair <key>=<value>\" with "
"\"pair=key=value\" specification, which instead would have defined a "
"\"--pair=key <value>\" option."
