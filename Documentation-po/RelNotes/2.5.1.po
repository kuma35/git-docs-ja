"Often a fast-import stream builds a new commit on top of the previous commit "
"it built, and it often unconditionally emits a \"from\" command to specify "
"the first parent, which can be omitted in such a case.  This caused fast-"

"scratch, which was inefficient.  Optimize for this common case."

"\"pair=key=value\" specification, which instead would have defined a \"--"
