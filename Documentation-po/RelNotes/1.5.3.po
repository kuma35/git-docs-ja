"at the supermodule level do not recurse into submodules by\n"
"default.  The expectation is that later we would add a\n"
"mechanism to tell git which submodules the user is interested\n"
"in, and this information might be used to determine the\n"
"recursive behaviour of certain commands (e.g. \"git checkout\"\n"
"and \"git diff\"), but currently we haven't agreed on what that\n"
"mechanism should look like.  Therefore, if you use submodules,\n"
