"We used to allow committing a path \".Git/config\" with Git that is running "
"on a case sensitive filesystem, but an attempt to check out such a path with "
"Git that runs on a case insensitive filesystem would have clobbered "
"\".git/config\", which is definitely not what the user would have expected.  "
"Git now prevents you from tracking a path with \".Git\" (in any case "
"combination) as a path component."

"On Windows, certain path components that are different from \".git\" are "
"mapped to \".git\", e.g. \"git~1/config\" is treated as if it were "
"\".git/config\".  HFS+ has a similar issue, where certain unicode codepoints "
"are ignored, e.g. \".g\\u200cit/config\" is treated as if it were "
"\".git/config\".  Pathnames with these potential issues are rejected on the "
"affected systems.  Git on systems that are not affected by this issue "
"(e.g. Linux) can also be configured to reject them to ensure cross platform "
"interoperability of the hosted projects."
