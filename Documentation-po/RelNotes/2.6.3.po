"The name-hash subsystem that is used to cope with case insensitive "
"filesystems keeps track of directories and their on-filesystem cases for all "
"the paths in the index by holding a pointer to a randomly chosen cache entry "
"that is inside the directory (for its ce->ce_name component).  This pointer "
"was not updated even when the cache entry was removed from the index, "
"leading to use after free.  This was fixed by recording the path for each "
"directory instead of borrowing cache entries and restructuring the API "
"somewhat."
