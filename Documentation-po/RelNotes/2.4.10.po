"xdiff code we use to generate diffs is not prepared to handle extremely "
"large files.  It uses \"int\" in many places, which can overflow if we have "
"a very large number of lines or even bytes in our input files, for example.  "
"Cap the input size to somewhere around 1GB for now."

"Some protocols (like git-remote-ext) can execute arbitrary code found in the "
"URL.  The URLs that submodules use may come from arbitrary sources (e.g., ."
"gitmodules files in a remote repository), and can hurt those who blindly "
"enable recursive fetch.  Restrict the allowed protocols to well known and "
"safe ones."
