"presence of the corresponding *.pack file before downloading *.idx file by "
"issuing a HEAD request.  Github server however sometimes gave 500 (Internal "
"server error) response to HEAD even if a GET request for *.pack file to the "
"same URL would have succeeded, and broke clone over HTTP from some of their "
"repositories.  As a workaround, this verification has been removed (as it is "
"not absolutely necessary)."
