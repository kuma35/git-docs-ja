"v1.6.1 introduced an optimization for \"git push\" into a repository (A)  "
"that borrows its objects from another repository (B) to avoid sending "
"objects that are available in repository B, when they are not yet used by "
"repository A.  However the code on the \"git push\" sender side was buggy "
"and did not work when repository B had new objects that are not known by the "
"sender.  This caused pushing into a \"forked\" repository served by v1.6.1 "
"software using \"git push\" from v1.6.1 sometimes did not work.  The bug was "
"purely on the \"git push\" sender side, and has been corrected."
