"\"git-shell\" rejects a request to serve a repository whose name begins with "
"a dash, which makes it no longer possible to get it confused into spawning "
"service programs like \"git-upload-pack\" with an option like \"--help\", "
"which in turn would spawn an interactive pager, instead of working with the "
"repository user asked to access (i.e. the one whose name is \"--help\")."
