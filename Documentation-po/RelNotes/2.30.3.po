"CVE-2022-24765: On multi-user machines, Git users might find themselves "
"unexpectedly in a Git worktree, e.g. when another user created a repository "
"in `C:\\.git`, in a mounted network drive or in a scratch space. Merely "
"having a Git-aware prompt that runs `git status` (or `git diff`) and "
"navigating to a directory which is supposedly not a Git worktree, or opening "
"such a directory in an editor or IDE such as VS Code or Atom, will "
"potentially run commands defined by that other user."
