"mark_tree_uninteresting() has code to handle the case where it gets passed a "
"NULL pointer in its 'tree' parameter, but the function had 'object = "
"&tree->object' assignment before checking if tree is NULL.  This gives a "
"compiler an excuse to declare that tree will never be NULL and apply a wrong "
"optimization.  Avoid it."
