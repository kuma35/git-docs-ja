"Traditionally, tips of branches and tags (collectively known as 'refs') were "
"stored one file per ref in a (sub)directory under `$GIT_DIR/refs` "
"directory.  While many branch tips tend to be updated often, most tags and "
"some branch tips are never updated.  When a repository has hundreds or "
"thousands of tags, this one-file-per-ref format both wastes storage and "
"hurts performance."

"This command is used to solve the storage and performance problem by storing "
"the refs in a single file, `$GIT_DIR/packed-refs`.  When a ref is missing "
"from the traditional `$GIT_DIR/refs` directory hierarchy, it is looked up in "
"this file and used if found."

"A recommended practice to deal with a repository with too many refs is to "
"pack its refs with `--all` once, and occasionally run `git pack-refs`.  Tags "
"are by definition stationary and are not expected to change.  Branch heads "
"will be packed with the initial `pack-refs --all`, but only the currently "
"active branch heads will become unpacked, and the next `pack-refs` (without "
"`--all`) will leave them unpacked."

"The command by default packs all tags and refs that are already packed, and "
"leaves other refs alone.  This is because branches are expected to be "
"actively developed and packing their tips does not help performance.  This "
"option causes branch tips to be packed as well.  Useful for a repository "
"with many branches of historical interests."
