"Git has an internal interface for storing and retrieving credentials from "
"system-specific helpers, as well as prompting the user for usernames and "
"passwords. The git-credential command exposes this interface to scripts "
"which may want to retrieve, store, or prompt for credentials in the same "
"manner as Git. The design of this scriptable interface models the internal C "
"API; see credential.h for more background on the concepts."
