"Trace the evolution of the line range given by '<start>,<end>', or by the "
"function name regex '<funcname>', within the '<file>'. You may not give any "
"pathspec limiters.  This is currently limited to a walk starting from a "
"single revision, i.e., you may only give zero or one positive revision "
"arguments, and '<start>' and '<end>' (or '<funcname>') must exist in the "
"starting revision.  You can specify this option more than once. Implies "
"`--patch`.  Patch output can be suppressed using `--no-patch`, but other "
"diff formats (namely `--raw`, `--numstat`, `--shortstat`, `--dirstat`, "
"`--summary`, `--name-only`, `--name-status`, `--check`) are not currently "
"implemented."
