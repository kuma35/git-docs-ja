"Lets you rewrite Git revision history by rewriting the branches mentioned in "
"the <rev-list options>, applying custom filters on each revision.  Those "
"filters can modify each tree (e.g. removing a file or running a perl rewrite "
"on all files) or information about each commit.  Otherwise, all information "

"The command will only rewrite the _positive_ refs mentioned in the command "
"line (e.g. if you pass 'a..b', only 'b' will be rewritten).  If you specify "

"normally have no effect.  Nevertheless, this may be useful in the future for "
"compensating for some Git bugs or such, therefore such a usage is permitted."
