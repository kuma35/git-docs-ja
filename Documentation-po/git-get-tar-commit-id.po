"Read a tar archive created by 'git archive' from the standard input and "
"extract the commit ID stored in it.  It reads only the first 1024 bytes of "
"input, thus its runtime is not influenced by the size of the tar archive "
"very much."

"If no commit ID is found, 'git get-tar-commit-id' quietly exists with a "
"return code of 1.  This can happen if the archive had not been created using "
"'git archive' or if the first parameter of 'git archive' had been a tree ID "
"instead of a commit ID or tag."
