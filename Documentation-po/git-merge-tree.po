"Reads three tree-ish, and output trivial merge results and conflicting "
"stages to the standard output.  This is similar to what three-way 'git "
"read-tree -m' does, but instead of storing the results in the index, the "
"command outputs the entries to the standard output."

"This is meant to be used by higher level scripts to compute merge results "
"outside of the index, and stuff the results back into the index.  For this "
"reason, the output from the command omits entries that match the <branch1> "
