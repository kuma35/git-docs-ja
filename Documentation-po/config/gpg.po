"Use this custom program instead of \"`gpg`\" found on `$PATH` when making or "
"verifying a PGP signature. The program must support the same command-line "
"interface as GPG, namely, to verify a detached signature, \"`gpg --verify "
"$signature - <$file`\" is run, and the program is expected to signal a good "
"signature by exiting with code 0, and to generate an ASCII-armored detached "
"signature, the standard input of \"`gpg -bsau $key`\" is fed with the "
"contents to be signed, and the program is expected to send the result to its "
"standard output."
