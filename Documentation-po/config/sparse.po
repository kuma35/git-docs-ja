"Typically with sparse checkouts, files not matching any sparsity patterns "
"are marked with a SKIP_WORKTREE bit in the index and are missing from the "
"working tree.  Accordingly, Git will ordinarily check whether files with the "
"SKIP_WORKTREE bit are in fact present in the working tree contrary to "
"expectations.  If Git finds any, it marks those paths as present by clearing "
"the relevant SKIP_WORKTREE bits.  This option can be used to tell Git that "
"such present-despite-skipped files are expected and to stop checking for "
"them."

"Set this to `true` if you are in a setup where some external factor relieves "
"Git of the responsibility for maintaining the consistency between the "
"presence of working tree files and sparsity patterns.  For example, if you "
"have a Git-aware virtual file system that has a robust mechanism for keeping "
"the working tree and the sparsity patterns up to date based on access "
"patterns."

"files unless sparse checkout is enabled, so this config option has no effect "
