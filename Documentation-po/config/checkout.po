"When you run `git checkout <something>` or `git switch <something>` and only "
"have one remote, it may implicitly fall back on checking out and tracking "
"e.g. `origin/<something>`. This stops working as soon as you have more than "
"one remote with a `<something>` reference. This setting allows for setting "
"the name of a preferred remote that should always win when it comes to "
"disambiguation. The typical use-case is to set this to `origin`."

"Currently this is used by linkgit:git-switch[1] and linkgit:git-checkout[1] "
"when `git checkout <something>` or `git switch <something>` will checkout "
"the `<something>` branch on another remote, and by linkgit:git-worktree[1] "
"when `git worktree add` refers to a remote branch. This setting might be "
"used for other checkout-like commands or functionality in the future."

"The number of parallel workers to use when updating the working tree.  The "

"Note: parallel checkout usually delivers better performance for repositories "
"located on SSDs or over NFS. For repositories on spinning disks and/or "
"machines with a small number of cores, the default sequential checkout often "
"performs better. The size and compression level of a repository might also "
"influence how well the parallel version performs."

"When running parallel checkout with a small number of files, the cost of "
