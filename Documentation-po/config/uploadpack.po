"output nothing at all until the pack data begins. Some clients and networks "
"may consider the server to be hung and give up. Setting this option "
"instructs `upload-pack` to send an empty keepalive packet every "
"`uploadpack.keepAlive` seconds. Setting this option to 0 disables keepalive "
"packets entirely. The default is 5 seconds."
