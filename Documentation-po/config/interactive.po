"In interactive commands, allow the user to provide one-letter input with a "
"single key (i.e., without hitting enter).  Currently this is used by the "
"`--patch` mode of linkgit:git-add[1], linkgit:git-checkout[1], "
"linkgit:git-restore[1], linkgit:git-commit[1], linkgit:git-reset[1], and "
"linkgit:git-stash[1]. Note that this setting is silently ignored if portable "
"keystroke input is not available; requires the Perl module Term::ReadKey."

"When an interactive command (such as `git add --patch`) shows a colorized "
"diff, git will pipe the diff through the shell command defined by this "
"configuration variable. The command may mark up the diff further for human "
"consumption, provided that it retains a one-to-one correspondence with the "
"lines in the original diff. Defaults to disabled (no filtering)."
