"1.4.4, either directly or via a dumb protocol such as http, then you need to "

"When true, git will write a bitmap index when packing all objects to disk "
"(e.g., when `git repack -a` is run).  This index can speed up the \"counting "
"objects\" phase of subsequent packs created for clones and fetches, at the "
"cost of some disk space and extra time spent on the initial repack.  This "
"has no effect if multiple packfiles are created.  Defaults to true on bare "
"repos, false otherwise."
