"to by this variable.  The location of the mailmap file may be in a "

"Like `mailmap.file`, but consider the value as a reference to a blob in the "
"repository. If both `mailmap.file` and `mailmap.blob` are given, both are "
"parsed, with entries from `mailmap.file` taking precedence. In a bare "
"repository, this defaults to `HEAD:.mailmap`. In a non-bare repository, it "
"defaults to empty."
