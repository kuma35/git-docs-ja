"Alias for a --pretty= format string, as specified in linkgit:git-log[1]. Any "
"aliases defined here can be used just as the built-in pretty formats "
"could. For example, running `git config pretty.changelog \"format:* %H %s\"` "
"would cause the invocation `git log --pretty=changelog` to be equivalent to "
"running `git log \"--pretty=format:* %H %s\"`.  Note that an alias with the "
"same name as a built-in format will be silently ignored."
