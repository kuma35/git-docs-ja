"Command aliases for the linkgit:git[1] command wrapper - e.g.  after "
"defining `alias.last = cat-file commit HEAD`, the invocation `git last` is "
"equivalent to `git cat-file commit HEAD`. To avoid confusion and troubles "
"with script usage, aliases that hide existing Git commands are "
"ignored. Arguments are split by spaces, the usual shell quoting and escaping "
"is supported.  A quote pair or a backslash can be used to quote them."

"Note that the first word of an alias does not necessarily have to be a "
"command. It can be a command-line option that will be passed into the "
"invocation of `git`. In particular, this is useful when used with `-c` to "
"pass in one-time configurations or `-p` to force pagination. For example, "
"`loud-rebase = -c commit.verbose=true rebase` can be defined such that "
"running `git loud-rebase` would be equivalent to `git -c commit.verbose=true "
"rebase`. Also, `ps = -p status` would be a helpful alias since `git ps` "
"would paginate the output of `git status` where the original command does "
"not."

"If the alias expansion is prefixed with an exclamation point, it will be "
"treated as a shell command.  For example, defining `alias.new = !gitk --all "
"--not ORIG_HEAD`, the invocation `git new` is equivalent to running the "
"shell command `gitk --all --not ORIG_HEAD`.  Note that shell commands will "
"be executed from the top-level directory of a repository, which may not "
"necessarily be the current directory.  `GIT_PREFIX` is set as returned by "
"running `git rev-parse --show-prefix` from the original current "
"directory. See linkgit:git-rev-parse[1]."
