"If no branch is specified and neither `-b` nor `-B` nor `--detach` is used, "
"then `git worktree add` defaults to creating a new branch from HEAD.  If "
"`worktree.guessRemote` is set to true, `worktree add` tries to find a "
"remote-tracking branch whose name uniquely matches the new branch name.  If "
"such a branch exists, it is checked out and set as \"upstream\" for the new "
"branch.  If no such match can be found, it falls back to creating a new "
"branch from the current HEAD."
