"When the split index feature is used, this specifies the percent of entries "
"the split index can contain compared to the total number of entries in both "
"the split index and the shared index before a new shared index is written.  "
"The value should be between 0 and 100. If the value is 0 then a new shared "
"index is always written, if it is 100 a new shared index is never written.  "
"By default the value is 20, so a new shared index is written if the number "
"of entries in the split index would be greater than 20 percent of the total "
"number of entries.  See linkgit:git-update-index[1]."

"When the split index feature is used, shared index files that were not "
"modified since the time this variable specifies will be removed when a new "
"shared index file is created. The value \"now\" expires all entries "
"immediately, and \"never\" suppresses expiration altogether.  The default "
"value is \"2.weeks.ago\".  Note that a shared index file is considered "
"modified (for the purpose of expiration) each time a new split-index file is "
"either created based on it or read from it.  See "
"linkgit:git-update-index[1]."
