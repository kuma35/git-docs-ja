"By default, Git does not create an extra merge commit when merging a commit "
"that is a descendant of the current commit. Instead, the tip of the current "
"branch is fast-forwarded. When set to `false`, this variable tells Git to "
"create an extra merge commit in such a case (equivalent to giving the "
"`--no-ff` option from the command line). When set to `only`, only such "
"fast-forward merges are allowed (equivalent to giving the `--ff-only` option "
"from the command line). This setting overrides `merge.ff` when pulling."
