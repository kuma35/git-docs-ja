"Any URL that starts with this value will be rewritten to start, instead, "
"with <base>. In cases where some site serves a large number of repositories, "
"and serves them with multiple access methods, and some users need to use "
"different access methods, this feature allows people to specify any of the "
"equivalent URLs and have Git automatically rewrite the URL to the best "
"alternative for the particular user, even for a never-before-seen repository "
"on the site.  When more than one insteadOf strings match a given URL, the "
"longest match is used."

"Note that any protocol restrictions will be applied to the rewritten URL. If "
"the rewrite changes the URL to use a custom protocol or remote helper, you "
"may need to adjust the `protocol.*.allow` config to permit the request.  In "
"particular, protocols you expect to use for submodules must be set to "
"`always` rather than the default of `user`. See the description of "
"`protocol.allow` above."

"Any URL that starts with this value will not be pushed to; instead, it will "
"be rewritten to start with <base>, and the resulting URL will be pushed "
"to. In cases where some site serves a large number of repositories, and "
"serves them with multiple access methods, some of which do not allow push, "
"this feature allows people to specify a pull-only URL and have Git "
"automatically use an appropriate URL to push, even for a never-before-seen "

"given URL, the longest match is used.  If a remote has an explicit pushurl, "
"Git will ignore this setting for that remote."
