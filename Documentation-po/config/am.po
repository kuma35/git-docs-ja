"If true, git-am will call git-mailsplit for patches in mbox format with "

"lines ending with `\\r\\n`. Can be overridden by giving `--no-keep-cr` from "
"the command line.  See linkgit:git-am[1], linkgit:git-mailsplit[1]."

"By default, `git am` will fail if the patch does not apply cleanly. When set "
"to true, this setting tells `git am` to fall back on 3-way merge if the "
"patch records the identity of blobs it is supposed to apply to and we have "
"those blobs available locally (equivalent to giving the `--3way` option from "
"the command line). Defaults to `false`.  See linkgit:git-am[1]."
