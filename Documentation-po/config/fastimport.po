"If the number of objects imported by linkgit:git-fast-import[1] is below "
"this limit, then the objects will be unpacked into loose object files.  "
"However if the number of imported objects equals or exceeds this limit then "
"the pack will be stored as a pack.  Storing the pack from a fast-import can "
"make the import operation complete faster, especially on slow filesystems.  "
"If not set, the value of `transfer.unpackLimit` is used instead."
