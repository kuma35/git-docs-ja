"This setting overrides the default of the `--cleanup` option in `git "
"commit`. See linkgit:git-commit[1] for details. Changing the default can be "
"useful when you always want to keep lines that begin with comment character "
"`#` in your log message, in which case you would do `git config "
"commit.cleanup whitespace` (note that you will have to remove the help lines "
"that begin with `#` in the commit log template yourself, if you do this)."
