"May be \"advertise\" (the default), \"allow\", or \"ignore\". If \"advertise"
"\", the server will respond to the client sending \"unborn\" (as described "
"in protocol-v2.txt) and will advertise support for this feature during the "
"protocol v2 capability advertisement. \"allow\" is the same as \"advertise\" "
"except that the server will not advertise support for this feature; this is "
"useful for load-balanced servers that cannot be updated atomically (for "
"example), since the administrator could configure \"allow\", then after a "
"delay, configure \"advertise\"."
