"May be \"advertise\" (the default), \"allow\", or \"ignore\". If "
"\"advertise\", the server will respond to the client sending \"unborn\" (as "
"described in protocol-v2.txt) and will advertise support for this feature "
"during the protocol v2 capability advertisement. \"allow\" is the same as "
"\"advertise\" except that the server will not advertise support for this "
"feature; this is useful for load-balanced servers that cannot be updated "
"atomically (for example), since the administrator could configure \"allow\", "
"then after a delay, configure \"advertise\"."
