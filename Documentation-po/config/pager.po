"If the value is boolean, turns on or off pagination of the output of a "
"particular Git subcommand when writing to a tty.  Otherwise, turns on "
"pagination for the subcommand using the pager specified by the value of "
"`pager.<cmd>`.  If `--paginate` or `--no-pager` is specified on the command "
"line, it takes precedence over this option.  To disable pagination for all "
"commands, set `core.pager` or `GIT_PAGER` to `cat`."
