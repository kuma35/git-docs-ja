"A \"patch ID\" is nothing but a sum of SHA-1 of the file diffs associated "
"with a patch, with whitespace and line numbers ignored.  As such, it's "
"\"reasonably stable\", but at the same time also reasonably unique, i.e., "
"two patches that have the same \"patch ID\" are almost guaranteed to be the "
"same thing."

"When dealing with 'git diff-tree' output, it takes advantage of the fact "
"that the patch is prefixed with the object name of the commit, and outputs "
"two 40-byte hexadecimal strings.  The first string is the patch ID, and the "
"second string is the commit ID.  This can be used to make a mapping from "
"patch ID to commit ID."
