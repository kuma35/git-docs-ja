"Note that Git at the core level treats path names simply as sequences of "
"non-NUL bytes, there are no path name encoding conversions (except on Mac "
"and Windows). Therefore, using non-ASCII path names will mostly work even on "
"platforms and file systems that use legacy extended ASCII "
"encodings. However, repositories created on such systems will not work "
"properly on UTF-8-based systems (e.g. Linux, Mac, Windows) and vice versa.  "
"Additionally, many Git-based tools simply assume path names to be UTF-8 and "
"will fail to display other encodings correctly."
