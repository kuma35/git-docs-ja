"The format of a <refspec> parameter is an optional plus `+`, followed by the "

"A <refspec> may contain a `*` in its <src> to indicate a simple pattern "

"If a refspec is prefixed by `^`, it will be interpreted as a negative "

"considered to match if it matches at least one positive refspec, and does "
"not match any negative refspec. Negative refspecs can be useful to restrict "
"the scope of a pattern refspec so that it will not include specific refs.  "
"Negative refspecs can themselves be pattern refspecs. However, they may only "
"contain a <src> and do not specify a <dst>. Fully spelled out hex object "
"names are also not supported."

"There is a difference between listing multiple <refspec> directly on 'git "
"pull' command line and having multiple `remote.<repository>.fetch` entries "
"in your configuration for a <repository> and running a 'git pull' command "
"without any explicit <refspec> parameters.  <refspec>s listed explicitly on "
"the command line are always merged into the current branch after fetching.  "
"In other words, if you list more than one remote ref, 'git pull' will create "
"an Octopus merge.  On the other hand, if you do not list any explicit "
"<refspec> parameter on the command line, 'git pull' will fetch all the "
"<refspec>s it finds in the `remote.<repository>.fetch` configuration and "
"merge only the first <refspec> found into the current branch.  This is "
"because making an Octopus from remote refs is rarely done, while keeping "
"track of multiple remote heads in one-go by fetching more than one is often "
"useful."
