"While Git can store and handle any file of any type, there are some settings "
"that work better than others.  In general, we recommend that text files be "
"stored in UTF-8 without a byte-order mark (BOM) with LF (Unix-style) "
"endings.  We also recommend the use of UTF-8 (again, without BOM) in commit "
"messages.  These are the settings that work best across platforms and with "
"tools such as `git diff` and `git merge`."

"Additionally, if you have a choice between storage formats that are text "
"based or non-text based, we recommend storing files in the text format and, "
"if necessary, transforming them into the other format.  For example, a "
"text-based SQL dump with one record per line will work much better for "
"diffing and merging than an actual database file.  Similarly, text-based "
"formats such as Markdown and AsciiDoc will work better than binary formats "
"such as Microsoft Word and PDF."

"Similarly, storing binary dependencies (e.g., shared libraries or JAR files) "
"or build products in the repository is generally not recommended.  "
"Dependencies and build products are best stored on an artifact or package "
"server with only references, URLs, and hashes stored in the repository."

"We also recommend setting a linkgit:gitattributes[5] file to explicitly mark "

"can set the attribute `text=auto`.  For example, the following might be "
