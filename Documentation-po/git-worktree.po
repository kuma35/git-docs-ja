"A git repository can support multiple working trees, allowing you to check "

"tree is associated with the repository.  This new working tree is called a "
"\"linked working tree\" as opposed to the \"main working tree\" prepared by "
"linkgit:git-init[1] or linkgit:git-clone[1].  A repository has one main "
"working tree (if it's not a bare repository) and zero or more linked working "

"add <path> <branch>`. On the other hand, if you just plan to make some "
"experimental changes or do testing without disturbing existing development, "
"it is often convenient to create a 'throwaway' working tree not associated "

"To prevent a `$GIT_DIR/worktrees` entry from being pruned (which can be "
"useful in some situations, such as when the entry's working tree is stored "
"on a portable device), use the `git worktree lock` command, which adds a "

"`/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next` then a file named "
"`/path/main/.git/worktrees/test-next/locked` will prevent the `test-next` "
