"In order to protect the privacy of objects that have been removed from "
"history but may not yet have been pruned, `git-upload-archive` avoids "
"serving archives for commits and trees that are not reachable from the "
"repository's refs.  However, because calculating object reachability is "
"computationally expensive, `git-upload-archive` implements a stricter but "
"easier-to-check set of rules:"

"Clients may request a commit or tree that is pointed to directly by a "

"Clients may _not_ use other sha1 expressions, even if the end result is "
"reachable. E.g., neither a relative commit like `master^` nor a literal sha1 "

"Note that rule 3 disallows many cases that do not have any privacy "
"implications. These rules are subject to change in future versions of git, "
"and the server accessed by `git archive --remote` may or may not follow "
"these exact rules."

#. type: Plain text

"If the config option `uploadArchive.allowUnreachable` is true, these rules "
"are ignored, and clients may use arbitrary sha1 expressions.  This is useful "
"if you do not care about the privacy of unreachable objects, or if your "
"object database is already publicly available for access via non-smart-http."
