"Remove files matching pathspec from the index, or from the working tree and "
"the index. `git rm` will not remove a file from just your working "
"directory. (There is no option to remove a file only from the working tree "
"and yet keep it in the index; use `/bin/rm` if you want to do that.) The "
"files being removed have to be identical to the tip of the branch, and no "
"updates to their contents can be staged in the index, though that default "
"behavior can be overridden with the `-f` option.  When `--cached` is given, "
"the staged content has to match either the tip of the branch or the file on "
"disk, allowing the file to be removed from just the index. When "
"sparse-checkouts are in use (see linkgit:git-sparse-checkout[1]), `git rm` "
"will only remove paths within the sparse-checkout patterns."
